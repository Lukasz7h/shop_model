# shop_model

Default login data --- login: lukasz -- password: 123456

Folder data contain database of shop_model.

That project was create by front-end framework 'Angular' --version 12.1.1 and back-end framework 'NestJS'.
At that projact I used database management system MariaDB to store data about users and shop stuff.
I also create chat to communicate between admin and guest which use web-socket's library 'Socket.IO'.
